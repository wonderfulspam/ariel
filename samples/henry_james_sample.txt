Brooksmith by Henry James (Excerpt)

We are scattered now, the friends of the late Mr. Oliver Offord; but whenever we chance to meet I think we are conscious of a certain esoteric respect for each other. "Yes, you too have been in Arcadia," we seem not too grumpily to allow. When I pass the house in Mansfield Street I remember that Arcadia was there. I don't know who has it now, and don't want to know; it's enough to be sure that if I should ring the bell there would be no such answer to it as in the old days.

"Good evening, sir," Brooksmith would say, standing in the doorway with his perfect manner—not humble, not familiar, but beautifully respectful.

I often wondered what became of Brooksmith. Mr. Offord had died suddenly one evening—he had simply, as we used to say, passed away in his chair. The doctor came and went, but there was nothing to be done. It was as if he had been a lamp that somebody had turned down.

The day after the funeral I went to the house. Brooksmith was there, but he was different. He opened the door with his usual ceremony, but when I asked him how he was, he answered:

"Oh sir, it's sad for you, very sad indeed, and for a great many gentlemen and ladies; that it is, sir. But for me, sir, it is, if I may say so, still graver even than that."

"What do you mean, Brooksmith?"

"Well, sir," he replied, with a visible effort to compose himself, "for me, sir, he was just all, if you know what I mean, sir. He was my life, sir, if you'll allow me to say so."

I was struck by the dignity of his grief. "But surely you'll find another situation?"

"Oh sir," said Brooksmith with a faint smile, "do you think there could be another situation like this one? Do you think there's another gentleman in London like Mr. Offord?"

"Well, perhaps not exactly, but—"

"No sir, there isn't. I've been thinking about it, and I know there isn't. This house, sir, was different. The people who came here—yourself, sir, and the others—you were all so clever, so interesting. And Mr. Offord, he brought out the best in everyone. That's a gift, sir, a very rare gift."

I stayed and talked with him for nearly an hour. He seemed grateful for the company, and I found myself deeply moved by his devotion to his late master. When I finally rose to leave, he said:

"Will you be good enough to come again, sir? Not regularly, you understand, but just when you're passing? It would be a kindness, sir."

"Of course, Brooksmith. I'll come whenever I can."

"Thank you, sir. It helps to talk about him, if you know what I mean. To someone who knew him as he really was."

As I walked away, I reflected on the strange situation. Here was a servant who had been more than a servant—he had been, in his way, a curator of a small but perfect world. And now that world was gone forever.
