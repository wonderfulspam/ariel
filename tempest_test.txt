The Tempest - Act I, Scene II (Excerpt)

MIRANDA: If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out.

PROSPERO: Be collected.
No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart
There's no harm done.

MIRANDA: O, woe the day!

PROSPERO: No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing
Of whence I am.

The storm that threatened to destroy the ship began to calm, as Prospero's magic settled over the island like a gentle mist.

ARIEL: All hail, great master! Grave sir, hail! I come
To answer thy best pleasure. Be't to fly,
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curled clouds, to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality.

PROSPERO: Hast thou, spirit,
Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee?

ARIEL: To every article.
I boarded the king's ship. Now on the beak,
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flamed amazement.
